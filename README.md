## Current Codebase
- Displays all movies in my personal movie collection
- When selected, additional movie details appear
- Has a switch between alphabetically organized and random
- Has a checkbox to filter out unwatched movies 

## Next Steps:
- Create a sidebar with different sorting and filtering options
- Sorting options:
	- Alphabetical
	- Rating (then alpha)
	- Release date
	- Genre (then alpha)
	- Random
- Filtering options:
	- Genres
	- Rating (5 stars, 4 stars & up, 3 stars & up, etc)
	- Runtime (less than 90 mins, 90 mins - 2 hours, etc)
- Create tagging system
- Attach movie search API to front-end form, allowing others to easily download and create their own movie library
